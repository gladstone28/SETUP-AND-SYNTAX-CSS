### SETUP AND SYNTAX

## External Stylesheet

Developers avoid mixing code by storing HTML and CSS code in separate files (HTML files contain only HTML code, and CSS files contain only CSS code).

You can create an external stylesheet by using the **.css** file name extension, like so: **style.css**

With an external stylesheet, you can write all the CSS code needed to style a page without sacrificing the readability and maintainability of your HTML file.
