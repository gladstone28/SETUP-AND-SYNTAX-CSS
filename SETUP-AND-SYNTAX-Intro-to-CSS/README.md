### SETUP AND SYNTAX

## Intro to CSS

While HTML is the fundamental structure of every web page, it can be visually unappealing on its own. Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is a language web developers use to style the HTML content on a web page. If you’re interested in modifying colors, font types, font sizes, images, element positioning, and more, CSS is the tool for the job!

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set up your CSS file structure and select which HTML elements you wish to style.
